This document shows how to use [AMM DEX Simulator (Uniswap v2/v3 model)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=1045257474#gid=1045257474), the best way to understand basics of DEX and DeFi!

If you are new to DeFi, I recommend playing with [Uniswap v2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=1045257474#gid=1045257474) sheet and read [Uniswap v2 Simulator Guide](#uniswap-v2-simulator-guide), since v2 is the foundation of all the DeFi logics. You'll grab what the famous 'x \* y = k' means, how the price is determined, and why slippage happens. In the [v3 simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=949789682#gid=949789682), we focus on LP and ignore swaps. This will allow you to understand what **concentrated liquidity model** means, and the importance of price range when adding LP.

## Uniswap v2 Simulator Guide

[Uniswap v2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=1045257474#gid=1045257474) sheet explains the basics of Uniswap v2's constant product AMM model. The sheet allows users to simulate real-world v2 swaps, liquidity provision, and understand LP rewards and slippage.

### üîç What is Uniswap v2?

Uniswap v2 is a decentralized exchange protocol that uses the **constant product formula** to enable token swaps without an order book. It operates under the formula:

```
x * y = k
```

Where:

- `x` = amount of Token0 in the pool (e.g., ETH)
- `y` = amount of Token1 in the pool (e.g., USDT)
- `k` = a constant, preserved during swaps

---

### About the Simulator

The sheet titled [`Uniswap v2`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=1045257474#gid=1045257474) models how the pool state evolves as users perform swaps and liquidity actions.

#### Initial Setup:

![Initial setup for v2](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.08.14@2x.png)

You can modify those labels and numbers, then start simulating transactions by entering one per row under the transaction table.

---

### Transaction Types

Each row represents one transaction. The supported types include:

| Type                         | Description                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Initialize (Add liquidity)` | Creates the initial pool state         |
| `Add liquidity`              | Adds Token0/Token1 pair to the pool    |
| `Remove liquidity`           | Withdraws LP tokens and returns assets |
| `Buy token0` / `Sell token1` | Executes a swap in either direction    |

In Uniswap v2 model (and also v3), initial pool state decides the starting price in AMM. You will see how easy to manipulate the initial price in DeFi world.

![Initialization by user name Tom](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.11.29@2x.png)

User name is just for visualization purpose. In AMMs, it's usually a wallet address.

### Key Outputs Calculated

| Column                                | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `token0/token1 price due to slippage` | Execution price after accounting for slippage |
| `AMM Slippage (inc. fee)`             | Total price impact including LP fee           |
| `Pool state after transaction`        | token0/token1 reserves after each action      |
| `k = x * y`                           | Constant product for internal consistency     |
| `LP Tokens Outstanding`               | Total LP tokens in circulation                |
| `Pool Ownership %`                    | Share held by each LP                         |

In v2 models, all the fees are just thrown into the LP pool for each token pair.

### Learning Outcomes

#### 1. **Price Discovery is Automatic**

![Prices are determined by the ratio of token reserves](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.38.32@2x.png)

Prices are determined **by the ratio of token reserves**. A swap of Token0 into the pool pushes up Token0's reserve and decreases Token1's, moving the price accordingly.

#### 2. **Slippage Depends on Pool Depth**

Larger swap amounts relative to pool size result in higher slippage.

For example, buying 10 ETH from a 1000 ETH pool results in moderate slippage. Buying 500 ETH would drastically impact the price.

#### 3. **LPs Earn from Swap Fees**

Each swap incurs a 0.3% fee as default, which **accrues to the liquidity pool**, increasing the total value of LP tokens.

#### 4. **LP Tokens Represent Share of the Pool**

When liquidity is added, LP tokens are minted proportionally. When removed, they're burned to return the LP's share of the reserves.

---

### Experiment Ideas

Make your copy of GSS, and try simulating the following:

- Execute multiple swaps and observe how the spot price and k-value evolve
- Add and remove liquidity at different pool states
- Track LP share and see how fee income accumulates over time

---

### Formula Recap: How a Swap Works

To compute a swap, the simulator uses the invariant:

```
(x + Œîx) * (y - Œîy) = k
```

Solving for `Œîy` (output token received), taking into account the fee:

```
Œîx_net = Œîx * (1 - fee)
Œîy = y - (k / (x + Œîx_net))
```

## Uniswap v3 Simulator Guide

This document explains the mechanics of Uniswap v3's **concentrated liquidity model** using Google Spreadsheet: [Uniswap v3 (LP)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=949789682#gid=949789682) and [v3 Tick and Price (In-range Only)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=1376548147#gid=1376548147). The simulator allows you to visually understand how liquidity provision and price movement work in v3.

### What is Uniswap v3?

Uniswap v3 is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that evolved the traditional AMM (Automated Market Maker) model by introducing the concept of **concentrated liquidity**.

#### Key Features:

- Liquidity providers (LPs) can specify the **price range** in which their funds are active
- Much higher **capital efficiency** than v2
- Liquidity density varies depending on the price range

---

### About the `Uniswap v3 (LP)` Sheet

In this [Uniswap v3 (LP)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=949789682#gid=949789682) simulator, you can configurate Tick/Tick Size/Tick Spacing.

| Parameter        | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tick**         | Distance from base tick (0 = price 1). Defines the total price range.     |
| **Tick Size**    | Price multiplier per tick. Smaller = finer price granularity.             |
| **Tick Spacing** | Interval between allowed liquidity positions. Smaller = more flexibility. |

![](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.43.31@2x.png)

Then, you can start simulating how different LPs provide liquidity with various strategies. Key input items include:

| Field                         | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Lower Limit` / `Upper Limit` | Price range in which the LP provides liquidity                      |
| `Token0 Deposit Input`        | Amount of Token0 deposited (e.g., ETH)                              |
| `Token1 Deposit Actual`       | Calculated amount of Token1 needed (e.g., USDT)                     |
| `Price Position`              | Indicates whether the current price is within the LP's active range |

![Price Position](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.54.23@2x.png)

> ‚úÖ If "In Range": the LP is actively participating and earns fees  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If "Out of Range" (Above/Below): the LP is inactive and earns no fees

---

### Virtual Liquidity (L) and Price Ticks

In Uniswap v3, the liquidity provided (L) is not spread across the price range. Instead, **it only becomes active when the current price falls within the LP‚Äôs specified range**.

#### Important Behavior:

- Only one **price tick** is active at any given time (based on the current price)
- The same L cannot be active across multiple ticks simultaneously
- As the price moves during swaps, L **slides to the next tick**, one at a time

---

### What `v3 Tick and Price` Sheet Shows

![v3 Tick and Price](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.25.43@2x.png)

[v3 Tick and Price (In-range Only)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=1376548147#gid=1376548147) outputs a snapshot of what virtual liquidity would look like if the price were located at each tick.

| Column                         | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tick`                         | Uniswap v3 price slot (integer)                                       |
| `Price`                        | Price converted from tick (1.0001^tick)                               |
| `Virtual token0/token1 amount` | Amount of virtual liquidity active at that tick                       |
| `token0/token1`                | Swap rate at that tick                                                |
| `LOG10`                        | logarithmic view of the relative proportion between token0 and token1 |

If you modify the price range on [Uniswap v3 (LP)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116VCvBF8l8nwWGqig2omDmrJLUXsb8s72oPGVkAk-Hc/edit?gid=949789682#gid=949789682), you'll know the importance of price range by looking at each row on this sheet. If no ranges, you'll end up seeing something like this. You add almost zero liquidity for the most ticks/prices.

![If no ranges, you'll end up seeing something like this. You add almost zero liquidity for the most ticks/prices](./images/CleanShot%202568-08-07%20at%2015.19.12@2x.png)

#### Clarification:

- LPs **do not directly deposit** liquidity into specific ticks
- This sheet assumes: _"What if the current price was at this tick?"_ and calculates virtual liquidity accordingly

---

### Intuition: One Tick at a Time

In Uniswap v2, liquidity is shared across the entire price curve ‚Äî like everyone putting money into one big bathtub.

In Uniswap v3, each LP builds **their own canal (price range)**. However, the **water (liquidity)** only flows **in the canal that matches the current price**.

> üí¨ ‚ÄúWater can only flow through one canal at a time.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the essence of v3.

---

### Try Out v3 Strategies in GSS

- **Narrow price range** (e.g., 3000‚Äì3100): highly efficient, but risk of being inactive if price moves
- **Wide price range** (e.g., 2000‚Äì5000): always active, but less fee income per dollar

This simulator helps you experiment with different LP strategies and visualize their outcomes.
