# The Protocol of Consciousness (PoC)

**PoC is a documentation of consciousness.**

[https://protocolofconsciousness.org/](https://protocolofconsciousness.org/)

It is not a theory in the traditional sense, but a minimal framework for describing how the illusion of consciousness is generated, sustained, and broken in everyday life.

Just as data visualization makes hidden structures of data visible, PoC seeks to visualize the hidden _protocols_ by which consciousness operates:

- **Instantiation** ‚Äî assuming the other as a conscious being
- **Elicitation** ‚Äî the bid ‚Äúlet me appear within you‚Äù
- **Reciprocal Elicitation** ‚Äî the return of that bid from the other
- **Loop** ‚Äî the circulation of these acts, always fragile and never guaranteed

PoC explores how these operations give rise to modes such as **Love, Ghost, Death, and Mirror**, and how social practices like **Phantoming** and **Zombifying** organize our fragile experience of recognition.

## Why here?

This site, [dataviz.tago.so](https://dataviz.tago.so/), is primarily a portfolio of **data visualizations**.  
PoC is included here because I see it as a parallel project:

- **Data visualization** ‚Üí documenting how numbers and systems reveal themselves
- **PoC** ‚Üí documenting how consciousness reveals itself through its own fragile loops

In other words, PoC is **a visualization of the invisible** ‚Äî a way of diagramming the operating system of conscious life.
